# CMARH-Project
The purpose of this project is to provide a specialized system that empowers organizations across the continent to map out and communicate their climate-related initiatives. This platform, tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities in Africa, will serve as a catalyst for collaborative climate and conservation action, easier research, and climate mitigation tracking. Additionally, the platform will feature a waste analysis tool, supporting recycling and waste management companies to optimize their operations and contribute to sustainable practices within the African context

#### Tri-Semester Project
During the second year, in the 2nd trimester, I was tasked with creating a project in relation to my mission.
* My mission is to drive conservation and climate mitigation efforts in Africa by leveraging cutting-edge technology so as to enable data-driven decisions in the next ten months, starting with Kenya
